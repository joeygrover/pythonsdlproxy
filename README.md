# sdl Proxy Python Implemetation

This is just for fun. It is no where near complete and I have no intention of completing it to 100%. I will work on it here and there to add more functionality, however, it was more an investigation into if it could be done and how it could work.

#### But I want a fully functional proxy written in Python!
Well, I don't know what to tell you.
